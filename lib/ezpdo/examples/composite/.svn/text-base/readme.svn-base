This is an example to show how EZPDO can handle complicated object 
relationships. The class hierarchy looks like this.

Graphic -+- Point
         |
         +- Line
         |
         +- Text

This is a simple example of the Composite design pattern. Each Graphic 
object can have a parent Graphic object and a set of child Graphic 
objects. EZPDO can persist all the composition relationships and you will 
find it is fairly easy to do with EZPDO.

To test the scripts: 

1. add Graphic objects into db

$ php add.php
$ php print.php

2. delete objects in db

$ php delete.php
$ php print.php
