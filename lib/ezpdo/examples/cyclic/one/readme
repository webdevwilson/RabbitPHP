This example is to test the cyclic access to one-valued 
("has one") overloaded properties. 

note that print.php & print_a.php print out the same contents in objects, 
but use different access methods. print.php uses the conventional '->' 
operator to access vars in objects, while print_a.php accesses vars as 
values of associated arrays by keys. 

1. add objects into db

$ php add.php
$ php print.php
$ php print_a.php

2. delete objects in db

$ php delete.php
$ php print.php
$ php print_a.php
